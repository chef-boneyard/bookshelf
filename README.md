Setup
-----

*[Erlang](http://www.erlang.org) R15

*[Virtualenv](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) (for integration testing)

### Host Name Setup

s3 works by specifying the bucket name as part of the domain name being resolved. So, for example, if we where trying to create bucket `foo` we would post a `PUT` to the domain `foo.localhost.localdomain` (in the common case). Unfortunately, that is not going to work on your local box. You can not specify wild cards for something like *.localhost.localdomain. To get around this problem we need to use some other tool. The recommended tool fir this is [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html). Get dnsmasq installed and then add

    address=/.localhost.localdomain/127.0.0.1

to `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`. This should make all buckets resolvable. It has some consequences for
